# First-Capstone-Project-Level-2-Java

In this project i had to create a project manager which allows the user to enter the details of the project, client informantion, architect information and contractor information.

A menu will prompt when the program starts where you can either add or edit a project:

If you choose to add a project a number of questions will be asked for the project, client, architect and contractor.
It will then print all the information neatly on the terminal!

This capstone will continue later on.
